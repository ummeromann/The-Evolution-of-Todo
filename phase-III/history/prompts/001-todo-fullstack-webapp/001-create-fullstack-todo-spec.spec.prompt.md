## Prompt

/sp.specify Todo Full-Stack Web Application

Target audience:
- Hackathon judges evaluating agentic, spec-driven, full-stack implementations
- Developers reviewing architecture, security, and workflow discipline

Focus:
- Transforming a console-based Todo app into a modern, multi-user, secure web application
- Implementing RESTful APIs, persistent storage, authentication, and responsive UI
- Demonstrating strict agentic workflow: spec → plan → tasks → implementation via Claude Code

Success criteria:
- All 5 basic Todo features implemented as a web application
- Fully functional REST API with CRUD operations for tasks
- Neon Serverless PostgreSQL used for persistent storage
- SQLModel used for schema design and ORM
- Better Auth implemented for user signup/signin
- JWT tokens issued and verified correctly
- All API routes secured and filtered by authenticated user
- Each user can only access and modify their own tasks
- Frontend built with Next.js 16+ App Router and is fully responsive
- Frontend successfully communicates with backend using JWT-secured requests
- Entire project can be regenerated using specs + prompts only

Constraints:
- Frontend: Next.js 16+ (App Router only)
- Backend: Python FastAPI
- ORM: SQLModel
- Database: Neon Serverless PostgreSQL
- Authentication: Better Auth with JWT plugin
- Workflow: Spec-Kit Plus + Claude Code + Agentic Dev Stack
- No manual coding allowed – all code must be generated by Claude Code
- No deviation from defined tech stack
- All secrets must be managed via environment variables
- Must follow RESTful API design
- Must use middleware for JWT verification in FastAPI

Timeline:
- Must be completable within hackathon timeframe
- Each spec must be completed sequentially with review before proceeding

Not building:
- Admin panel or role-based access control
- Advanced task features (labels, priorities, reminders, sharing)
- Real-time updates (WebSockets)
- Mobile application
- Third-party integrations beyond Better Auth and Neon
- UI animations or heavy design system
- Monolithic backend combined with frontend

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive feature specification for Todo Full-Stack Web Application:

**Branch**: `001-todo-fullstack-webapp`
**Spec File**: `specs/001-todo-fullstack-webapp/spec.md`

**User Stories** (7 total):
- P1: User Registration, User Sign-In (authentication foundation)
- P2: Create Task, View Tasks (core CRUD operations)
- P3: Update Task, Delete Task, Toggle Completion (supporting operations)

**Functional Requirements**: 21 requirements covering:
- Authentication & Authorization (FR-001 to FR-009)
- Task Management (FR-010 to FR-017)
- User Interface (FR-018 to FR-021)

**Key Entities**: User, Task

**Success Criteria**: 10 measurable outcomes including:
- Performance targets (registration <60s, task creation <10s)
- Security guarantees (100% auth enforcement)
- Functionality coverage (all 5 basic Todo operations)
- Regenerability requirement (SC-010)

**Quality Checklist**: All 16 items PASSED validation.

## Outcome

- Impact: Created comprehensive feature specification defining multi-user todo webapp requirements
- Tests: N/A (specification document)
- Files: 2 created (spec.md, checklists/requirements.md)
- Next prompts: /sp.plan to generate implementation plan
- Reflection: Specification is complete with no NEEDS CLARIFICATION markers due to comprehensive user input

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - user provided exceptionally detailed requirements
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Quality checklist 16/16 PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): N/A
